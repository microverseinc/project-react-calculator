# Milestone 1

## Introduction
Every project has its beginning in setting up some basic structure and tooling. You will build a calculator for Math-magicians Inc using `create-react-app`, a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications, saving you from time-consuming setup and configuration.

## Requirements

1. Use `create-react-app` to initialize a new React app
    - Documentation: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. Delete any unnecessary file or asset3. 
3. Add the necessary packages to your project:
    - Add [`big-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-js) using npm
4. Run the application with `npm start` and make sure that everything works correctly.
5. Follow the instructions in `create-react-app-buildpack` to deploy the app to Heroku
    - Initialize a git repo
    - Create a Heroku app
    - Commit and deploy to Heroku
    - Make sure the Heroku app works correctly
